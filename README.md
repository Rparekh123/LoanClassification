Approach

1. Importing the required libraries and reading the dataset.
    - Merging of the two datasets
    - Understanding the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
    - Data Visualization
3. Feature Engineering
    - Dropping of unwanted columns
    - Removal of null values
    - Checking for multi-collinearity and removal of highly correlated features
4. Model Building
    - Performing train test split
    - Logistic Regression Model
    - Weighted Logistic Regression Model
    - Naive Bayes Model
    - Support Vector Machine Model
    - Decision Tree Classifier
    - Random Forest Classifier
5. Model Validation
    - Accuracy score
    - Confusion matrix
    - Area Under Curve (AUC)
    - Recall score
    - Precision score
    - F1-score
6. Handling the unbalanced data using imblearn.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
    - Support Vector Machine Model
    - Decision Tree Model
    - Random Forest Model
8. Creating the final model and making predictions
